In this project, we aim to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and correlations within historical stock market data using exploratory data analysis. We start by meticulously preparing and visualizing the data, gaining invaluable insights that set the stage for our predictive modeling.
We meticulously clean, preprocess, and visualize the data, unearthing valuable information about price trends, trading volumes, and seasonality. we harness the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a class of deep learning models well-suited for sequential data. By leveraging past stock prices and trading volumes, we construct an LSTM model that learns intricate temporal patterns. We fine-tune our model and enhance its predictive accuracy using min-max normalization techniques.
